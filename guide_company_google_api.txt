I'll help you set up the Google Maps API keys for your company. Let me guide you through the process step by step:

First, you need to create an Organization in Google Cloud Console:
Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
Click on "Create Organization" or use an existing one if you have it
You'll need to verify your company's domain ownership:
This typically involves adding a DNS record or uploading an HTML file to your website
Have your domain administrator credentials ready
Create a Project:
Once your organization is set up, create a new project
Give it a business-appropriate name like "Limos-Rental-Maps"
This project will be linked to your organization
Set up Billing:
Click "Billing" in the left sidebar
Set up a business billing account
Add your company's payment method
You can set budgets and alerts to monitor costs
Consider enabling billing reports for accounting
Enable the Required APIs:
Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
Search for and enable these APIs:
Maps JavaScript API
Places API
Geocoding API
Distance Matrix API
Create API Key with Restrictions:
Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
Click "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
After creating, click the key to edit it
Set these restrictions:
Application restrictions:
Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
Add your production domain
Add your development domains (localhost:5173 for Vite development)
API restrictions:
Select "Restrict key"
Choose only the APIs you enabled
Quotas:
Set up quotas for each API to control costs
Once you have the API key, I'll help you implement it securely in your codebase. There are two approaches we can use:
A. Using Environment Variables (Recommended for security): Let me set this up for you:

Run command in terminal

Creating .env file for environment variables

echo VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here > .env
